# Python-DocBrowser
DocBrowser is a documentation browser for Python modules and files.
It offers a good way to navigate into classes, functions, modules or constants of a module and clearly see everything you have to know for using them, like the documentation, class's attributes, functions arguments or source code, in a beautiful GUI.

To use DocBrowser, just download the docBrowser.py file and execute it in a terminal. You can add a module name as an argument, otherwise you would have to type it in a window.
